    "This notebook builds, tunes, and evaluates machine learning models for employee attrition prediction using the cleaned dataset and the saved preprocessing pipeline from the previous notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Loads the cleaned dataset (`data_01.csv`)\n",
    "- Loads the saved preprocessing pipeline (`preprocessing_pipeline.pkl`)\n",
    "- Applies the transformations defined during preprocessing via the pipeline (feature engineering, encoding, scaling)\n",
    "- Trains and evaluates a Logistic Regression classifier\n",
    "- Assesses performance using both cross-validation and test set metrics\n",
    "- Interprets results using explainability techniques to highlight drivers of attrition"
